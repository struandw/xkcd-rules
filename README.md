# xkcd-rules

The following is a living document which describes the rules of [&xkcd](https://euphoria.io/room/xkcd).

## The Rules

1. ### The [Code of Conduct](https://euphoria.io/about/conduct) and [Terms of Service](https://euphoria.io/about/terms) are unquestionable.
Where the rules stated below conflict with the CoC and ToS, the Euphorian documents are automatically considered correct.

2. ### Where the rules or Euphorian documents leave room for interpretation, hosts may interpret.
No rule set can perfectly cover all cases. In situations where there is uncertainty, the word of the hosts is final.

3. ### You have the right to an appeal.
Hosts are human. If you think a host has made a bad call, you can ask another host or hosts to weigh in. The outcome of an appeal cannot be appealed.

4. ### Respect your fellow users
This means remaining civil and kind. It also means...

5. ### Don't spam
We all know what this means. But, to be clear, spam is:
- A subset of the users
- rapidly submitting posts
- that are not meaningful to everyone else
- and distracting to everyone else.

6. ### Do accept PMs
The hosts may use PMs to intervene if you're breaking the rules. If you get a PM request, please accept it. 

======

## Consequences

When you break the rules, there will be consequences. In general, they will be delivered in the order listed below, but some may be skipped at the discretion of the hosts.

- a discussion, either in public or in a PM room, about your actions
- removal of offending content
- a short time-out (up to 24 hours)
- a temporary ban (up to 30 days)
- a permanent ban
